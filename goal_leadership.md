## Leadership
NOTE: that whether or not 'leadership' is the right word to resonate across multiple FOSS communities is currently in debate.  
What we currently mean is:

* Community assigned role i.e. Mozilla Reps, Fedora Ambassador, Rust mod team member
* Advanced responsibility (informal or formal) i.e. advanced role permissions (to merge code)
* Mentorship (formal or informal)
* Project or Initiative Lead i.e. Drupal DB module owner
* Regional community organizer/lead i.e.  Openstack Vancouver

Goal: Identify how healthy our community leadership is.
