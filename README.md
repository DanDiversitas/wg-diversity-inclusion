# What is this working group about?

This working group aims at bringing experiences measuring diversity and inclusion in open source projects.

Its main goal focuses on understanding from a qualitative and quantitative point of view how diversity and inclusion
can be measured. This will bring four main outcomes:
* First a set of metrics curated by the community focused on understanding and measuring diversity
* Second learn good practices from open source communities on improving their diversity and inclusion
* Third produce useful software to measure diversity from a quantitative point of view. This is expected to produce generic software to analyze several repositories of information such as Git repositories or Mailing lists
* Fourth, good practices on how to deal with such data, maintain and ways of collaboration with open source communities.
* Fifth, a method that other communities can reproduce the report for themselves.

An example of the expected outcomes is the [OpenStack Gender Report](http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/bitergia-intel-report/)
that focuses on the analysis of the gender-diversity in the OpenStack Foundation. This project sponsored by Intel and Bitergia
aims at helping the community with data. And we need data to make decisions!

This project is under the [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community) project that is part of The Linux Foundation.

As the CHAOSS project consists of two Technical Committees: Software and Metrics, this project aims at
working closely with both and learn their best practices. In addition, this working group expects
to discuss new ideas in terms of metrics and software with both committees improving the knowledge
base around this topic.

*Note:* We want to make our tools and report inclusive globally.

## Upcoming meetings

- We meet every other week. Next meeting: June 6th, 2018 at 6pm Eurpean Central Time (9am US Pacific Time). We will use the CHAOSS Zoom room: https://unomaha.zoom.us/j/720431288


## Meeting Mintues
(located here until we find a better place for them)

### 2018-02-13

To-Do's:
- review existing survey work (Matt)
- review GrimoireLab software (Daniel)
- mentorship for OpenStack report (Daniel and Nicole)
- describe non-technical contributions and document what OpenStack diversity research captured (Nicole)

### 2018-02-27

no update, still working on To-Do's

### 2018-03-13

### 2018-05-23

Decide on next steps (see issues #14 and #15) and start a roadmap.

**Updates from OSLS**

Daniel, Nicole, Matt did a presentation on D&I. Attended by about 40 people. Presentation was focused more on using metrics. Still a ton of interest in CHAOSS and seeing the project move forward. Slides: https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/_media/chaoss/slides/2018-03-06_osls.diversityandinclusion.pdf


**Regarding the WG D&I**

There is a pull request right now on the metrics repository on the Diversity and Inclusion metric category. The pull request is about how we present the metrics. 
https://github.com/chaoss/metrics/pull/64


**Update from OpenStack survey**

The OpenStack survey v2 is almost ready (now has response options) and waiting for final feedback right now: 
https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/diversity-survey-spring-2018_draft
Will be sent out in short time.
The goal is to expand diversity beyond gender diversity and make sure that everyone feels welcome.
Yearly repeat the survey to see if initiatives are being effective.

### 2018-03-18

We discussed the goals of the workgroup and started defining categories in which we understand diversity and inclusion:

### 2018-03-25

We worked on the session proposal for the Open Source Summit North America:

## Mailing list
We use the CHAOSS mailing list: https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/chaoss/metrics#mail-list
Please start the subject with the tag [wg-di].

## Metrics Work

More to be done.

Metrics used in OpenStack Gender Report --- starting point for thinking about other diversity and inclusion metrics.

__Governance and Leadership__

 - Board of Directors
 - Technical Committee
 - User Committee
 - Working Groups Chairs
 - OpenStack Ambassadors
 - Project Technical Leaders
 - OpenStack Foundation Officers
 - Ratio of minority identification to whole community
 - Role in community (basis for calculating minority ratios within each committee/workgroup/organ)

__Summits Representation__

 - Keynote summits representation
 - Summit attendees
 - Summit speakers

__Technical Contributions__

 - Number of commits by minority over time
 - Number of developers by minority authoring those commits over time
 - Types of contributions (code and others) by minority within those commits over time
 - Number of code review submissions by  minority over time
 - Number of developers who have submitted changesets, by minority over time
 - Number of code review votes undertaken by developers, by minority over time
 - Number of developers who have voted in a code review process, by minority over time
 - Number of core code review votes undertaken by developers, by minority over time
 - Number of core code review votes undertaken by developers, by minority over time
 - Number of developers who have participated in a core code review process, by minority over time
 - Ratio_Authors: The number in this column denotes the ratio of minority developers for every 100 developers for a given project.
 - Ratio_Commits: The number in this column denotes the ratio of commits submitted by minority developers for every 100 commits submitted by all developers for a given project.
 - Authors: The number in this column denotes the total number of individuals identified as minority who have contributed to a given project, as tracked through the Git repositories.
 - Commits: The number in this column denotes the total number of changes to the source code for a given project. A commit is usually submitted through a code review process.

__Non Technical Contributions__

 - Number of emails by gender
 - Emails activity by gender
 - Characterization of mailing lists (development, users)


__Minority identities__

Standard survey questions for identity relating to diversity:
https://github.com/drnikki/open-demographics/tree/master/doc-source/questions

 - Age
 - Disability
 - Education
 - Gender
 - Language
 - Location
 - Race
 - Religion
 - Sexual and Romantic Orientation
 - Socioeconomic Class

## Software Work

To be done

## How can you help?

This project is open to anyone interested in the topic of diversity and inclusion. And this includes several areas
of work such as diversity and inclusion from a broader perspective, mining software repositories, Python development,
tech writing, people interested in speaking at events and others.

The collaboration guide is still in progress, but a first good step would be to introduce yourself at the
[CHAOSS Metrics](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/oss-health-metrics) or
[CHAOSS Software](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/chaoss-software) mailing lists explaining
a bit your interest.

Most of the work in the metrics side will be done through pull requests to the markdown files containing discussions
about the metrics used or to be used. This is the same method as when updating the software side of the project.
