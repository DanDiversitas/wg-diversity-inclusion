# What is this working group about?

This working group aims at bringing experiences measuring diversity and inclusion in open source projects.

Its main goal focuses on understanding from a qualitative and quantitative point of view how diversity and inclusion
can be measured. This will bring four main outcomes:
* First a set of metrics curated by the community focused on understanding and measuring diversity
* Second learn good practices from open source communities on improving their diversity and inclusion
* Third produce useful software to measure diversity from a quantitative point of view. This is expected to produce generic software to analyze several repositories of information such as Git repositories or Mailing lists
* Fourth, good practices on how to deal with such data, maintain and ways of collaboration with open source communities.

An example of the expected outcomes is the [OpenStack Gender Report](http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/bitergia-intel-report/)
that focuses on the analysis of the gender-diversity in the OpenStack Foundation. This project sponsored by Intel and Bitergia
aims at helping the community with data. And we need data to make decisions!

This project is under the [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community) project that is part of The Linux Foundation.

As the CHAOSS project consists of two Technical Committees: Software and Metrics, this project aims at
working closely with both and learn their best practices. In addition, this working group expects
to discuss new ideas in terms of metrics and software with both committees improving the knowledge
base around this topic.

## How can you help?

This project is open to anyone interested in the topic of diversity and inclusion. And this includes several areas
of work such as diversity and inclusion from a broader perspective, mining software repositories, Python development,
tech writing, people interested in speaking at events and others.

The collaboration guide is still in progress, but a first good step would be to introduce yourself at the
[CHAOSS Metrics](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/oss-health-metrics) or
[CHAOSS Software](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/chaoss-software) mailing lists explaining
a bit your interest.

Most of the work in the metrics side will be done through pull requests to the markdown files containing discussions
about the metrics used or to be used. This is the same method as when updating the software side of the project.


## Communication Channels


* Metrics and Software Discussions mailing list at [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/contact/)
* CHAOSS Community IRC Channels: #chaoss-community at freenode
* Face to face meetings during the Open Source Summits or in other events such as FOSDEM.
