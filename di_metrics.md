# Category: Diversity and Inclusion

Goal: Identify the diversity and inclusion within a project.

### Definitions

* **Diversity**: How different are the people present?
* **Inclusion**: How well do we enable these different people to work together?
* **Retention**: How long do different people stay engaged?
* **Attraction**: How well do we extend a hand to different newcomers?

*Example 1:* Two people in a room. They can be diverse, but they don’t have to work together or be there still tomorrow.  AND just because someone is there, doesn’t mean their experience is good.

*Example 2:* Some minorities are not necessarily visible, do we want to measure their degree of visibility/outness? (e.g., disability, socio-economic, LGBTIQ, religion)

*Example 3:* There may be women within a community that is less inclusive, but the women are determined to “see it through” and participate. In this case, retention does not necessarily reflect the level of inclusion within a community.

Code of Conduct at Event | How does the Code of Conduct for events support diversity and inclusion? [*(Note: we had these sub-bullet points and I think they should go on the detail page for this metric and overarching question, but until we create that page, we can keep them here) Is a Code of Conduct present for an event and visible? Is the Code of Conduct enforced? What is the sentiment towards the Code of conduct? Is the CoC trusted? Do people believe that the CoC is real? What is the readiness to report CoC violations? Are the steps known within minority groups? Do we see real differences in diversity and inclusion when we change the CoC?*]
