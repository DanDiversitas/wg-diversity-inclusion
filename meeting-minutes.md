**Updates from OSLS**

Daniel, Nicole, Matt did a presentation on D&I. Attended by about 40 people. Presentation was focused more on using metrics. Still a ton of interest in CHAOSS and seeing the project move forward.

**Regarding the WG D&I**

There is a pull request right now on the metrics repository on the Diversity and Inclusion metric category. The pull request is about how we present the metrics.

The OpenStack survey v2 is almost ready (now has response options) and waiting for final feedback right now:
https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/diversity-survey-spring-2018_draft
Will be sent out in short time.
The goal is to expand diversity beyond gender diversity and make sure that everyone feels welcome.
Yearly repeat the survey to see if initiatives are being effective.
